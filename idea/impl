an expression value is represented by exactly one of
	-- literal int value
	-- number (id) of a compiler temporary
	-- number (id) of a local variable

a snippet stores
	a set of all used
		* monitors
		* shared variables
		* volatile variables
	a vector of all local variables (including compiler temporaries) idents
	a [local variable name -> local variable id] map
	a list of instructions; possible instructions:
		monitor lock (monitor ident)
		monitor unlock (monitor ident)
		arithmetic operation (local target, 2x local value, operation type)
		shared read	(local target, shared ident)
		shared write (shared ident, local value)
		volatile read (local target, volatile ident)
		volatile write (volatile ident, local value)
		print
		move ~ write to a local variable
